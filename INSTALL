BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
===================

NOTES:

Linux users can build with the build.sh script.  This script will build
the Linux client and server, and Windows clients.  The script will attempt
to automatically download the WinDivert dependency, otherwise it can be
specified by the '-d <windivert-install-path>' option.

LINUX:

    1) Make sure that the following packages are installed (e.g. with apt-get
       install):
       - gcc
       - autoconf
       - libssl-dev (server only)
       - libgmp3-dev (server only)

    2) Run the following commands:
       $ autoconf
       $ ./configure
       $ make client_install
       $ make server_install        # (server)
       $ make client_install32      # (32-bit client)

FREEBSD:

    NOTE: freebsd version can only be built on a FreeBSD system.

    NOTE: to run the freebsd version you need to enable ipfw and divert
          sockets, i.e., ipfw_load="YES" and ipdivert_load="YES"

    1) Make sure that the following packages are installed (e.g. with
       pkg_add -r):
       - gcc
       - autoconf
       - sudo (& add yourself as a sudoer)
       - gmake (& replace make with gmake)

    2) Run the following commands:
       $ autoconf -o configure configure-freebsd.ac
       $ ./configure
       $ make client_install_freebsd

MACOSX:

    NOTE: to run the macosx version you need to enable ipfw and divert
          sockets.

    1) Make sure the following packages are installed:
       - gcc
       - autoconf

    2) Run the following commands:
       $ autoconf -o configure configure-freebsd.ac
       $ ./configure
       $ make client_install_macosx

WINDOWS [LINUX CROSS COMPILATION]:

    1) Make sure the following packages are installed:
       - WinDivert      [http://reqrypt.org/windivert.html]
       - mingw-w64
       - nsis
       - autoconf

    2) Run the following commands:

       (32-bit version)
       $ autoconf -o configure configure-windows.ac
       $ ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 'DIVERT=path/to/windivert/'
       $ make client_install_windows

       (64-bit version)
       $ autoconf -o configure configure-windows.ac
       $ ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 'DIVERT=path/to/windivert/'
       $ make client_install_windows

WINDOWS [NATIVE COMPILATION]:

    Note: This method cannot be used to build the 64-bit version.
    Note: This method is no longer supported, use Linux cross-compilation
          instead.

    1) Make sure the following packages are installed:
       - WinDivert      [http://reqrypt.org/windivert.html]
       - MinGW
       - MSYS
       - NSIS

    2) Run the following commands:
       $ autoconf -o configure configure-windows.ac
       $ ./configure 'DIVERT=path/to/divert/'
       $ make client_install_windows
