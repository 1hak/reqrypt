Linux users can build with the build.sh script.  This script will build
the Linux client and server, and Windows clients.  The usage is:
    $ ./build.sh -d <divert-install-path>
where <divert-install-path> is a path to a WinDivert binary package.
WinDivert binary package can be downloaded from:
    http://reqrypt.org/divert/
